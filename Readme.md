STW WebTransformation R1 - HAR Parser

What is it?
The application takes a folder containing HAR records of all STW website pages, and produce a CSV file listing a summary of network calls made by each one of them. The result is listed/summarised based on the domain name used in the network calls.

How to use this?

The application consumes web page network log in HAR format. 

To prepare the HAR records for the application to consume, open each page you want to include in the analysis in Firefox, then open Firefox native Developer Tools, go to Network panel, then refresh the page, wait for the page to finish loading and then right click on any network log record in the network panel and select “Save All as HAR”. Save the car file with a name that matches the page name that you would like it to appear as in the CSV file to be generated by the application.

Checkout the code from this repository (https://github.com/huanjiayang/STW-HAR-Parser.git) and build/run as a Maven Java Application.

The application, on start, will ask user to enter the full path to the folder containing all the HAR records.

The application then generates a CSV file in its root folder named STWNwkLog.csv listing the results. CSV files can then be opened directly in MS Excel as a spreadsheet for viewing/editing.
